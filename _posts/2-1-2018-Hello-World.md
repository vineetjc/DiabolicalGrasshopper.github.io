title: A new passion?
---

Hello, world.

Never in my life did I think I would open a blog page or something of that sort. Some kids in my school did, but I wonder about their commitment. I sometimes thought they did it to show off that they maintain a blog so that the colleges they applied to would be impressed by it. Some of the blogs I know even stopped after a while. Seeing my friends, I realized it would be a really tough thing to commit to, and decided to not do it at all. Hey, why take the pain, right? :p

I wonder how far I will go with this. But I have a feeling I will take this up better than I would have in the past. I may not write something frequently of course, but I know for sure that I will write something or the other. I feel a voice inside me that wants to speak. It could be something as simple as a project I've been working on, or as big as about an issue in the world that needs addressing. It will all be there because I know I do things only when I'm very passionate and enthusiastic about it. The same will apply for each blog post I shall write in the future - if I will write it, it's because I am/will be passionate about that something I will write.

Passion is my primary reason to do things. This post could serve as a double meaning, if that's the right way to put it - my first "hello world" was with my most favourite activity - programming, and now it hopefully will be with blogging.

Hello, world. Let's explore and keep the passion alive.

I am the Diabolical Grasshopper.
