Better late than never, I guess? :p

I had a great experience being a mentor for this edition of KWoC. I got around 30 students joining the Gitter channels for my 3 projects, and I am glad to see that there was tremendous progress. In the end, the rate of contributions stagnated a little bit, but understandably so, because a lot of effort was put during the month of December. In just a matter of weeks, a lot of changes were pushed and I am happy believing that somewhere I helped a bunch of students learn how to contribute, to work on a project and to learn working with Python and Pygame.

Before you proceed, I would like to suggest you all to check out my [first post on becoming a mentor at KWoC] in hopes of seeing the effect the contributors have created (like a significant 'before-after' comparison).

## 1. [Search the Key]

[Search the Key]: https://github.com/vineetjc/pygame-Search-the-Key

#### Summary of progress
There was considerable progress, but I think the mentees could have done better. To be fair on them though, most of them (at least seemed like) were relatively new to this kind of workflow and contributing to projects. I'm still proud of the contributors for giving it a go.

#### Summary of progress
This project (out of the three) was the one that gained the most traction according to me. And that probably reflects in the significant contributions that were made. The game has improved visually, code is better structured and we have many game modes now.

## 3. [Fetch Amul Topicals]

[Fetch Amul Topicals]: https://github.com/vineetjc/fetch-amul-topicals

#### Summary of progress
A lot of issues were fixed that now make this a lot better than how I could do it myself. I still have the goal of making a web app for displaying the topicals. Hopefully, I find new (and more) contributors who can help me do this, but I really want to implement that idea and make that a nice project to work on.

I want to thank all my mentees for considering to work on my projects and I hope they learned something new while at it. I hope I have been a good mentor myself and was just to the KWoC program. I look forward to more such programs and opportunities to get in touch with people and collaborate with them.

The program has ended, and I'm happy with the overall progress of my projects and my mentees. I've learnt a lot myself, not just in terms of being a mentor, but making better contributions myself in the middle of the program to help others. I hope I've inspired a few to continue learning and contributing.

More on my projects when something nice pops up!
