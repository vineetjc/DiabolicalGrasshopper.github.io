I'm taking part in this year's [IIT Kharagpur Winter of Code (KWoC)], but this time as a mentor!

I'm very excited about this new opportunity that I got, and I hope to keep tracking progress on my projects with time.

[Last year, I worked on a great project called AirHockey], so this year I decided to return the favour by putting out my projects for students to work on. These are my projects at the start of KWoC and I'm writing this in hopes of showing how they will turn out to be at the end of this programme.

## 1. [Search the Key]
This is a game I made as part of my 12th-grade project, [Monopoly-Custom], as a mini-game that features in the Chance and Community Chest, and as a way to Get out of Jail in the main game.

[Search the Key]: https://github.com/vineetjc/pygame-Search-the-Key

#### Description
A game in which player searches for a key in a 5x5 grid in 6 turns with indications on how 'hot' or 'cold' they are with respect to the location of the key.

This is how the game looked like before KWoC began, hopefully, it'll change and be a lot better by the end of the month:

## 2. [Coin Fall game]
This is also a mini-game I made as part of [Monopoly-Custom] that goes with Search the Key. (Now that I think of it, I did way too much for 3 marks of my 100 for my 12th-grade Computer Science).

[Monopoly-Custom]: https://github.com/vineetjc/Monopoly-Custom
[Coin Fall game]: https://github.com/vineetjc/pygame-Coin-Fall-

#### Description
Use your arrow keys to collect as many falling coins as possible in 30 seconds. Avoid the bombs!

Here's the 'before' pic of this game, and I can already tell that it is looking way better at the present (teaser, hold on for updates).

## 3. [Fetch Amul Topicals]
This is a Python web scraper that I was fortunate to work on at the end of my first year as part of NIT-Calicut's CSE Association's Summer Mentorship Programme. I believe I'm one (of possibly very few students) who had a success in this program and I got in touch with a very kickass (if I must say) alumnus who helped me learn about Open Source and with my first ever Pull Request on this project! (mind you, that's a very big moment in a budding developer's life).

[Fetch Amul Topicals]: https://github.com/vineetjc/fetch-amul-topicals

#### Description
A Python scraper that fetches (and has the option to download) 'topicals' from Amul's website. My long-term goal with it is to make a web app that displays the topicals in an easy to navigate format, much like a comic strip.

Now, I can't show a proper picture for this, but to get an idea, I can use this program to download images from [this website] like those below (and these topicals are very clever!):

One of the things I'd like to happen (let's even call it a goal of mine for now) is to get students (including myself) to start venturing into development and Open Source development in the future, and I'd love to teach and help newcomers with programming and working on projects in a team. I've always had the passion for gaining knowledge, but more importantly, for sharing that knowledge with others and helping them learn. With this, even if one person gets even a little to learn, I would feel like I'm doing well on my goal to teach.

More on my projects every week! (and I hope that the work will be so good that I'd have to write separate posts for each project's progress!)
